# Additional Resources
Each week I'll try to include more information and resources for you to review after class. These are things that will either add to and complement the material discussed in lecture, or they will introduce you to material that will be discussed the following week.  (These are also great things to use in the chatroom as conversation starters.)  

### What is an Algorithm?

## Lab Algorithms
Some algorithms from lab explained for the Yale CS50 class.

### Linear Search

### Binary Search

Note that this version of the binary search is a little different than what you did in lab, as it uses a technique called recursion.  We'll discuss this more later if you are in the 4-credit class.  You can also learn a bit about it here: [Recursion](https://youtu.be/t4MSwiqfLaY)


## More Sorting Algorithms

### 15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes
You might want to mute this...  Note the name of the algorithm is at the top along with some information on accesses and comparison counts.  More trade-offs!
