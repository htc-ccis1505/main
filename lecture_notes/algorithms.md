# Today's topic is algoritms!
What do you think of when you hear the word "algorithm"?  What do you think it means?  Where do you think it is used?


## What is an algorithm?

>A finite set of unambiguous instructions that, given some set of initial conditions, can be performed in a prescribed sequence to achieve a certain goal and that has a recognizable set of end conditions.
> ~[American Heritage Dictionary](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/algorithm)

Simply put, it is a set of steps that allow us to solve a particular problem. As we've seen with other computing terms, we use algorithms all the time. We just have different names for them.

- A recipe is an algorithms.
- Instructions for assembling a toy or furniture are algorithms.
- The steps an electrician uses to wire a circuit or that a plumber uses to run pipes for a bathroom are algorithms.
- Help desks have scripts that staff should follow to identify and troubleshoot problems.  

Can you think of other algorithms in your daily life?

## Multiple Choices
As we've discussed before, there will usually be more than one way to solve a particular problem. Consider all the different recipes for making something like chocolate chip cookies. There are multiple recipes that you can use, but not all of the outcomes will be the same. Different recipes have different trade-offs. Some recipes will have conditions that impact your ability to use them, for example, some may take longer to prepare than others.

In choosing between recipes, you will need to consider trade-offs.  For example it may take longer to use a higher quality recipe, but the food may not be done in time for dinner.  What other trade-offs might you consider when selecting a recipe?

Some ideas:

- Cost of ingredients vs quality
- Amount of sugar or fat vs taste
- Gluten free or vegan vs some people not being able to eat it


## Algorithms in Computing
Computer science algorithms are conceptual solutions to a problem (such as sorting a list), whereas the implementation of an algorithm is the actual code that brings the solution to life. The implementations themselves can typically be written in almost any programming language and run on any computer; the concepts behind the algorithm are not affected by these types of conditions, in the same way that the outcome of a well-written recipe should (hopefully) not be affected by the cook or kitchen.

What do you think some trade-offs for computer science algorithms might be? Computer science is loaded with trade-offs and being able to choose between them is a critical skill for creating useful software.

## Searching
Search algorithms are commonly used in computing and are easy to conceptualize and understand.  Take a sheet of paper and tear it into a few pieces.  Write a random number on each one.  Now think about how you would try to find a single number from all of them.  Write down the steps that you would go through, one by one so that someone else could repeat them exactly - even if the numbers were different.  

Be careful to pay attention to each step of the process - your algorithm.

Donâ€™t skip anything!  This is the hardest part.

Remember to think like a computer and use sequences, choices, loops.


### Reflecting
Think back on your algorithm.  Answer the following questions.

- What was the gap between your largest and smallest number?  Did that matter?
- How many numbers did you have overall?  Did that matter?
- Did you have any duplicate numbers? Did that matter?
- What trade-offs might you need to consider?  Would you choose a different process based on answers to any of the above?


Algorithms are important in computing, but they are also important to many different fields.  Take a few minutes to consider why you think this topic is relevant to you and your future career choices.
