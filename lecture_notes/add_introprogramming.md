# Additional Resources
At the bottom of the lecture notes, I'll include more information and resources for you to review after class. These are things that will either add to and complement the material discussed in lecture, or they will introduce you to material that will be discussed the following week.  (These are also great things to use in the chatroom as conversation starters.)  


## Computational Thinking

Please read through this short (3 page) paper, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf" target="_blank">Computational Thinking</a>, by Jeannette M. Wing.  There will likely be some terms and concepts here that you do not recognize or understand yet, but that's ok.  Make a note of them, look them up, ask about them in chat.  Most likely we will be addressing them later in the course.



Following up on that, the following video, Solving Problems at Google using Computational Thinking (&lt; 5 min), talks about how computational thinking is used at Google.  Google Earth / Maps is one of the examples.

## Working With Others
This post, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#rtfm" target="_blank">How to Ask Questions the Smart Way</a>, is used on many *help* websites and discussion forums, but it's just as relevant when asking for help in class or on the job.  It is a little lengthy, but at least skim over it.  If you post a chatroom question, or email a question to me.  Please, do your own looking for the answer first, then ask a good question.

The following video, Does Pair Programming have to suck? by Angela Harms (50 min), is from a Ruby conference.  It talks a bit about why some people don't like or have bad experiences with pair programming.  I encourage you to listen to it, and use what you learn to make you classroom pairing experiences better.
