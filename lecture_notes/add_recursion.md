# Additional Resources
This week's additional resources include both some extra information on the Caesar Cipher for Project 3, and recursion.

### Caesar Cipher

### Caesar Cipher Using ASCII Codes

Note: that the video discusses python functions for conversion between a character to ASCII, but Snap has similar blocks <code>unicode of [a]</code> and <code>unicode [#] as letter</code>.  This is helpful for the "extras", but not needed for the base project.

### Recursion

This again uses snippets of code in other languages, however it still does a nice job of explaining the concept itself.  Don't get hung-up on the code syntax.
