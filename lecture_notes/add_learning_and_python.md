# Additional Resources
Each week I'll try to include more information and resources for you to review after class. These are things that will either add to and complement the material discussed in lecture, or they will introduce you to material that will be discussed the following week.  (These are also great things to use in the chatroom as conversation starters.)  

## Why Should You Learn to Code
[No, seriously, why should I learn to code?](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/09/30/no-seriously-why-should-i-learn-to-code/) by Al Sweigart, author of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)


## Learn how to Learn
We talked a little that first day of class about learning from and not being afraid of making mistakes.  We watched a little short Nike ad featuring Michael Jordan, and talked a bit about persistence and determination and how the most important thing you can do to learn programming is to keep trying.  Here are some follow ups to that.

## Play with Python
I'd encourage you not to get too distracted by python yet, and to use good judgement on where to put your limited time.  However, there are many, many python resources and references on the web, including this one that allows you to play with python in the browser:
[Learn Python](http://www.learnpython.org) browser based tutorials from learnpython.org

### Set it up at home!
We'll be getting to this later, but if you are curious, no need to wait.

If you use Windows, you will want to download and install python 2.7.  When complete, you'll also want to add python to your path.  There are some pointers in the document linked below, but this is a bit better [Stack Overflow Set Python in Path](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-7).  If you are not using Windows 7, you can use Google and/or YouTube to help you, and ask if you are really stuck.
[Install Python 2.7](https://docs.python.org/2.7/using/windows.html)

If you use Mac OS X, you should have python 2 already waiting for you to discover it.  Open a Terminal window (use Google if you aren't sure how to do this) and type in `python --version` and see if it comes back with version information.  If the command isn't recognized, then you need to install it.  I recommend using Homebrew for this by following the steps here [Installing Python on Mac](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/). You can (optionally) stop before installing SetupTool & PIP unless you plan to be doing more of this later on.
