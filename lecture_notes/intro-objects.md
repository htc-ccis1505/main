We're going to work our way into this a little gently.  Meet Bart, my fuzzy grey cat.  

<img src="/assets/christmasBart-sm.jpg" alt="Picture of Mary and her fuzzy grey cat Bart wearing a Santa hat (and not looking too happy about it).">

So Bart is a ______?  Cat.  A cat is a _______?  Feline.  A feline is a _____?  Mammal.  A mammal is a _______?  Animal

Each step of the way here, we've gotten more general.  Each time we do that we lose some specific information about what we're talking about.  When I talk about Bart, you know know I'm talking about a fuzzy grey cat who doesn't like Santa hats. That's pretty specific.  If I'm talking about my cat, you might think I'm talking about Bart, but you don't know that for sure.  What if I've got another cat?  

An Animal is pretty general.  It could be just about anything, right?  Not a tree, not a fungus, bacteria or virus... but anything else living.  That's pretty darn general.  Now if we talk about a mammal, we've narrowed things down a lot.  Now we've eliminated birds, bees, fish, reptiles, but we've still got lots of possibilities - lions, tigers, bears, goats, cows, people.  Get a bit more specific and talk about felines, and now we get rid of those bears, goats, cows, people, but we could still be talking about a lion or a tiger or a house cat.  

I'm guessing you all get this... this isn't a new idea, right?  We make generalizations all the time.  It's not something specific to programming.  Give me some other examples.

OK, so now we're going to take this up a notch and put it into practice. Lets say that I'm managing a vet's office.  I've got many patients, and Bart is one of them.  I've got to keep track of specifics about Bart, like his age, weight, the fact that he's male.  But then I've also got to keep track of that information for all the other cats I have as patients too.  So maybe I make a generic form to track data for a cat.  Oh, but I've got dogs as patients too.  They've got the same types of information.  Do I need a different form for dogs or do I make a general form that can be used for both?

Figuring out what level to generalize to is important.  Maybe there are things in common with dogs and cats and a single common form is fine.  Or maybe I need to track a list of vaccinations and that list is really different between dogs and cats.  That might mean that we have to have two forms, but they have some common data at the top, or maybe there is a common patient form and two vaccine forms.  Where and how much you can generalize depends on the details of a particular problem or situation.
