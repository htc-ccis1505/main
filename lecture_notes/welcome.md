# Welcome!

We're going to cover a lot of material tonight, and it'll go by fairly quickly.  Please stop me along the way if you have questions.

## Introductions
Mary Mosman - mary.mosman@hennepintech.edu

I'm a full-time instructor here at Hennepin Tech. I've been teaching here since 2008, and started teaching full-time in 2014. Before that I worked as a Java Web developer at a variety of companies throughout the Twin Cities. My expertise is in Java web development, and that includes a whole mess of related technologies for both the back-end (stuff you don't see) and front-end (stuff you do see). If you are interested in development as a career, I'm happy to share my experiences and offer advice to get you started.  If you're not sure if you're interested, I'm happy to try and persuade you. It's a great way to make a living. Seriously... not for a second do I wish I had chosen a different path.

Throughout the semester I'll post news on Twin Cities IT events. I try to stay fairly well involved in the local developer community, though that is harder now that I'm teaching every week night. However I encourage you to go to these events, it's a great opportunity to see what is going on in the area and learn something new.  Plus you get to meet people. I can't stress the "meet people" part enough, it's very helpful as you're getting started.

ONLINE
Online appointments are available by request.
Weekend appointment times may be available, but must be requested before 5 PM on Friday.

__Important__: The class chatroom or email is the best way to get in touch with me.  Technically I do have an office phone, but I am only in my office once or twice a week.  On the other hand, I am logged into email and our chatroom all day, and while I may not always be able to respond immediately, I will see your message and get back to you as soon as I am able.

## Courses
This is a combined section of two different courses.  The home page lists their official course descriptions and goals.  You'll notice if you look that there is an awful lot of overlap.  That's why we teach them together.  The 4 credit Fundamentals of Programming class has a few extra goals.  The nights that we cover that material, the 3 credit Web Programming Overview students do not need to attend (though you are welcome to if you are curious), and thus there is less work.

If you have questions or concerns about whether or not you are in the *right* course for your program or the *best* course for your future goals and objectives, talk with me over break. If you want to be in the other course, we can switch you between them.  Note that this is easy to do now, and somewhat harder to do later at least if you want to drop a credit.  


## Attendance & Participation
It is really important that you are here in class every week and that you remain in-class for the full class time.  There may be notes posted on the in-class material, but it is not guaranteed to have all of the details.  Yes, you will be tested on the material covered in-class.

If you must miss class, arrive late, or leave early, please send me an email and let me know.  You are still responsible for the material covered, so you may want to get notes or updates from a classmate.  

## In-class schedule
10 min. retrospective & review
50 min. lecture
2.5 hours lab time
20 min. wrap up & questions

We will begin the evening with a discussion of the previous week's work, followed by a lecture and interactive coding session to introduce and this material may not be available anywhere else.  I will post code to D2L, and there may be notes posted, but it is not guaranteed to have all of the details or information covered.  You will be tested on the material covered in the lectures.

The better part of the class will be interactive lab learning which you are expected to complete in-class with a partner. There will be a homework lab that follows up on this which will be due before the next class. You will be graded on the completion of the labs, and your participation and ability to work with your partner.  If you are not coming to class prepared and are not actively participating in lab, you should expect that to be reflected in your lab and participation grades.

## Materials - Text Book & Software
There is no textbook for this class.  All of the materials you need are available on the web, for free.  If you picked up the *recommended* text book for the other section, I'd suggest returning it.  That needs to be done the first two weeks of class and you will need a receipt.  

Snap! is an entirely browser-based blocks language supported on Chrome (recommended), Firefox, and Safari.  We will use Snap! in our early labs to master basic logic and build more interactive programs.  Later in the semester, we will use a text-based language called Python which is widely used both in academics and industry.

## Course Website
__Main Course Website: [htc-ccis1505.github.io/main](http://htc-ccis1505.github.io/main)__<br>
This has all of the lab and lecture information. It is hosted on GitHub, which means not only can you read the material, but you can also see all the nitty gritty of how it is put out there.  

__D2L Brightspace__
This is where you will go to take quizzes and to turn in assignments.  Official due dates are tied to the assignment dropboxes and the quizzes in D2L.  If you notice discrepancies between due dates on the schedule and in D2L, let me know as soon as possible.  Mistakes happen, but generally speaking the D2L date is official.

__Course Chat Room__
This is a way to reach out to me and your fellow students outside of class, you will need to create an account with Slack to access the chat room.  This is the best way to get help outside of class.  Please join the conversation and contribute.  If you know the answer to someone else's question please jump in and answer.  Participation here will also influence your participation grade for the course, and being especially helpful will earn you *bonus* points.  (More to come on that later.)

There are links to D2L and the chatroom on the course home page under Quicklinks.  There are also links to the main course website and chatroom on D2L.

__Student Email__
All email communication will come through D2L, which is configured by default to use your official student email account.  (You can edit the email address in your D2L profile.)  You are expected to check email regularly for updates, and are responsible for ensuring that you receive these messages.


## Grades
This is a quick summary of grading policies.  There is more information on grading on the course website and in the syllabus.  Please read through it and ask if you have any questions.  It's important to understand how your work and progress in the course will be assessed.

### Participation & Professionalism
The course schedule is posted on D2L and outlines session topics and major due dates for the semester. It is expected that you will attend and participate in class each week.  You will receive a weekly grade for the work done in class.  This may include one or more in-class activities or a quiz.

*_These assignments are in-class activities and cannot be made up or turned in late._*

To encourage participation, a portion of this grade will be based on effort and engagement.  This grade will be given at the end of the semester, and is a subjective value determined by the instructor and measures your engagement in class during lab and lecture as well as the online chat.

### Lab Assignments
Each week will have a combination of in-class and homework labs. In-class lab exercises are shorter and should be completed as a pair before the end of class.  Homework labs follow up on the topics introduced in class and should be done individually.  They are due in the D2L dropbox before the start of the next class.

###Projects
Project assignments are larger assignments intended to teach you how to combine ideas from the course in interesting ways. These will take more time to complete, and you should start them early to ensure that you finish on time.  You are encouraged to discuss the project with other students, but your final solution should be your own individual work.  Discuss concepts and share ideas, not code.

### Exams
There will be 3 exams that you will take in-class.  These cover discussion and concept questions from lecture and coding problems.  You will get a sheet of notes for for each exam, and you can also bring the previous exam notes as well.  So for the first exam you can have one sheet of notes.  For the second exam you can have two, and for the final exam you can have three sheets of notes. The notes must be handwritten (no tiny computer printing) and on a sheet of paper no larger than 8 x 11 inches. You may use both the front and back of the sheet of paper.  

The first two exams will be done with Snap!  The first exam will cover the material up to lists.  The second exam will cover all of our Snap! topics.  The final exam will be done in Python and may include any topic covered in the course.  This sounds tough, but it shouldn't seem so bad as you see how the topics covered one week lead into the next.  It is very much a cumulative course.  There's nothing you get to learn and then forget.

### Clobber Policy
The clobber policy allows you to replace one early exam grade with a later exam grade.  We will have three exams.  You can "clobber" any earlier exam with a later one - so use your second exam score to replace the first.  This is a one directional replacement.  You can't use a good early exam to replace a later one.  Thus, the last exam, the final exam, will always stick.  

Because of this policy I will not be offering make up exams.  The intent of this is to allow me to go over questions and answers from the exams with the class after the exam is given. This allows you to learn from your mistakes and see alternate ways to solve the problems.  In exceptional circumstances, a make-up or rescheduled final exam may be offered, but as that takes place the last week of class, it may result in an Incomplete grade.  This must absolutely *must* be discussed with the instructor before missing the exam and should be early as possible.

### Bonus Points
Over the course of the semester, you can earn *bonus* points for going above and beyond either in class, in the chatroom, or by doing the *extras* in the assignments. The amount of points that you accumulate over the semester may help bump you up over a grade boundary, i.e. from an B+ to an A. There is no set count of extra credit points, and the merits of the points are determined by the instructor as final grades for the class are determined.

## Academic Honesty
While you are encouraged to work with your peers, cooperation has a limit.  In this course, that limit is copying lines of code or using ideas that are not your own. Project assignments should be completed and turned in individually unless the assignment specifically calls for a partner. Feel free to discuss the assignments and projects with others. However, you should not be sharing lines of code with others, or reading code from other people's projects. Write your own programs and keep them to yourself.

We expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and complete your own projects. The assignments and evaluations are structured to help you learn, which is why you are in College. Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course!  There are many resources available to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the assignments, you won't need to copy any answers.

If you are caught sharing or copying work, regardless of whether you did the sharing or the copying, you will receive a zero for that assignment.  Repeat offenses will be formally submitted to the college for disciplinary action.  See the Student Code of Conduct policy for more information.

## Getting help
Your first and most important resource for help in learning the material in this course is your fellow students. Work closely with your lab partner or pair.  You are responsible for helping each other learn.  As you work with different students in the class, maintain those relationships from week to week through the online chat room.

If you have questions, then others might have as well, regarding projects, homework, course policies, etc., post your questions to the chat room.  This allows you to answer questions from other students as well. Your contributions (questions and answers) to this online forum will also contribute to your participation score in the course.  In asking and responding to questions, please be polite and respectful to others and conscious of the no code sharing policy.

To get help from me, you may drop in during office hours, catch me in chat, email me, or make an appointment to meet at another time.  The Learning Resource Center (LRC) locations and hours are posted below.  Please confirm hours on the [LRC website](https://www.hennepintech.edu/current/pages/259) as they may change.

Both the instructor and the LRC staff are available to assist you with assignments and answer questions, but we are not here to do them for you.  When working with us on a problem, it is important that you ask good questions and help us to understand the things that you have tried so that we can better help you learn.  We are there to help you find the solutions to the assignments, not to give them to you step by step.
