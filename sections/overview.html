    <h1>CCIS 1505 - Fund. of Programming</h1>
    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>This course is the first course for a student planning to study computer programming. The course content introduces the student to both procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming languages. Structured programs will be written with a computer programming language with an emphasis on procedure-oriented programming. Topics will include objects, classes, methods, properties, flowcharting, pseudocode, top down design, logic structures, data structures and types, decisions, subroutines, looping, sequential file processing, arrays and building graphical user interfaces.</p>

    <h2>Course Goals</h2>
    <p>The following goals will be addressed in the course:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply basic programming syntax</li>
      <li>Diagram program logic flow</li>
      <li>Use simple variables (strings/numbers)</li>
      <li>Use complex data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, arrays)</li>
      <li>Create program code to use iteration and looping</li>
      <li>Create program code that makes decisions and uses branching</li>
      <li>Use sequential files</li>
      <li>Create program statements that perform mathematical calculations</li>
      <li>Apply object-oriented programming techniques in writing programs</li>
      <li>Apply program debugging techniques and methods in program testing</li>
      <li>Construct subroutines and functions in program development and packaging</li>
      <li>Generate programs that have graphical user interfaces</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Computing is one of the biggest forces of innovation and societal transformation of today. It opened up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. Knowing the fundamentals of computing allows a person to understand and relate to the why’s and how’s of this transformation.
